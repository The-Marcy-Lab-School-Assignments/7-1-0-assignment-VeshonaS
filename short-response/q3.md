# Question

Imagine that somewhere, you have already created a context object called `SomeContext`. 

```js
// context/SomeContext.js
import { createContext } from "react";

const SomeContext = createContext();

export default SomeContext;
```

Modify the code snippet below such that:
1. The `App` component provides the value held by the `data` variable to its descendants using `SomeContext`.
2. The `Child` component is able to extract that `data` value from `SomeContext`.


# Answer

```js
import { useContext, useState } from 'react'
import SomeContext from "./context/SomeContext";

/** FEEDBACK: This is undeclared meaning there is no let or const keyword and should this useContext be here? Check you project to see an example! */
const useContext = SomeContext({data})

const Child = () => {
  return <p>{data}</p>
}

const Parent = () => {
  return <Child />
}
/** FEEDBACK: Great job however what should we wrap around our parent? */
const App = () => {
  const data = 'some data to provide via context';

  return (
    <Parent />
  )
}
```


# Feedback

You are very close, you forgot to wrap the provider around the parent.
